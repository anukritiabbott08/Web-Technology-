				<b>About me</b>
				<div class="introduction" style="text-align:justify;margin-right: 2%;">
					<p>I am currently enrolled in M.S. in Information Systems in Business Analytics at Marist College and this is to express my interest in obtaining an internship opportunity. I worked with Accenture for US and UK based clients and have 3.5 years of professional IT experience in both business and technical teams. 
					Currently I am working on-campus as an IT coordinator for the Information Technology Department of the school.</p>
					<p>I am a self-starter and I have proven myself to be someone who can be counted upon. My IT experience gives me a unique ability to apply technology in all its forms to business processes. I have gained knowledge and experience working as Application Developer  by delivering large technology projects in alignment with business strategy,
					assisted managers and senior executives, tutored new recruits at Accenture in SAP BusinessObjects, Informatica and IBM DataStage  and have been involved in managing client expectations on all my projects. </p>
